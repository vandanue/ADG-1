# Shell Scripting and Its Application in Seismic Unix

## What is Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is the process of writing a series of commands for a Unix shell (such as Bash, sh, or csh) to automate tasks. These scripts can execute programs, manipulate files, and control system operations, making repetitive tasks more efficient and less error-prone.

## Application in Seismic Unix

Seismic Unix (SU) is a collection of seismic data processing tools commonly used in geophysics. Shell scripting is widely used with SU to:

- **Automate Data Processing:** Run multiple SU commands in sequence to process seismic data without manual intervention.
- **Batch Processing:** Handle large datasets by looping over files and applying SU tools.
- **Workflow Management:** Organize complex processing workflows, including data conversion, filtering, stacking, and visualization.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent results by saving and sharing scripts with processing steps.

Shell scripting enhances productivity and reproducibility in seismic data analysis using Seismic Unix.

## Example: Seismic Unix Workflow in Bash

Below is a simple Bash script that demonstrates a typical SU workflow using `suwind`, `sufft`, and `suximage`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Select traces from input.su using suwind
suwind < input.su key=cdp min=100 max=200 > selected.su

# Apply Fast Fourier Transform to the selected traces
sufft < selected.su > fft.su

# Visualize the processed data
suximage < fft.su title="FFT of Selected Traces"
```

This script automates the selection of traces, applies a Fourier transform, and visualizes the result, illustrating how shell scripting streamlines seismic data processing with SU tools.
