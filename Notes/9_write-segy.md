# Write Out SEGY
We can use the `segywrite` program to convert SU files to SEGY format. When converting SEGY to SU, the `segyread` program also creates header and binary files. Conversely, `segywrite` requires header and binary files when converting SU to SEGY; if you lose those files (a common mistake), you can recreate them using `segyhdrs`.

For example, to export I create textual and binary header files for my post‑stack migrated data:

```bash
segyhdrs < Line_001_PoSTM.su bfile=Line_001.bin hfile=Line_001.txt
```

![hdrs](../img/img_16.png)

As you can see, the textual that generated by `segyhdrs` is not useful but you can edit this file to write out some information about processing sequence. But, dont use "Return" (or "Enter") key anywhere in this file.

This is my header for SEGY output.

```

Textual header has no carriage returns, no line feeds, so you just have to add EOF (end-of-file) at the end.

Now, I have textual and binary header files. I can export SU file to SEGY by using `segywrite`.

```bash
segywrite < Line_001_PoSTM.su tape=Line_001_PoSTM.sgy hfile=Line_001.txt bfile=Line_001.bin
```

The value of `tape=` is the name of the SEGY output.
